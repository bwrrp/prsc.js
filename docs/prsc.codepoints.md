## codepoints() function

Creates a Parser that skips code points while the given predicate returns true.

This counts in unicode characters (code points), not UTF-16 code units.

This acts like `starConsumed(codepoint(isMatch, []))` if expected is not set, or as `plusConsumed(codepoint(isMatch, expected))` if it is, but is much more efficient than either of those combinations.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function codepoints(isMatch: (codepoint: number) => boolean, expected?: string[]): Parser<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  isMatch | (codepoint: number) =&gt; boolean | callback called for each codepoint, should return whether that matches |
|  expected | string\[\] | expected strings to return if the first codepoint does not match |

<b>Returns:</b>
